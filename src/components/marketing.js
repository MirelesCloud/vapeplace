            <p className="card-text text-justify">Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid compound that has shown promising health benefits as a dietary supplement to help with inflammation, pain, anxiety, and other ailments. Yet, not all CBD products are the same. CBD is just one important component of a truly full-spectrum cannabinoid product. To maximize the effectiveness of a CBD product, it should retain all of the beneficial parts of the plant so it can work synergistically to give you the result you need. We believe a natural full-spectrum hemp product, void of harsh chemicals is optimal. Choose the natural and holistic approach.</p>

            <p className="card-text text-justify">Each full-spectrum hemp product is designed for different uses. CBD Drip Gold, Platinum, and Onyx are designed primarily for use in your favorite E-Liquid. Our RixMix brand can be used in your vape or a sublingual (under the tongue). ECOCaps and ECOGels are your daily use full-spectrum pill form hemp product to help bring balance and homeostasis. ECODrops are engineered with a particular focus in mind. When you need an additional boost, focus, relief or you just need to relax and dream away, use our ECODrops.

          <div className="card-body">
            <p className="card-text text-justify">Unlike many CBD products on the market, our CBD products are full-spectrum CBD-rich whole plant cannabinoid product. We use a responsible CO2 supercritical extraction method to extract all the beneficial parts of the hemp plant. Thus retaining all of the terpenes, cannabinoids, vitamins, lipids, nutrients, and compounds without using pesticides or using harsh chemical solvents. Donâ€™t buy CBD isolate products that state CBD is in its pure state. These use harsh chemical solvents like hexane and heptane, as well as, destroy the other essential compounds of the hemp plant. We believe in a natural full-spectrum hemp product, not a synthesized one.</p>
